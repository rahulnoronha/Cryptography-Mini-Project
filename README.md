# Cryptography-Mini-Project
<br/>
This is the Mini project done for the Cryptography course taught in semester 7. It is an application allowing the enciphering and deciphering of various types of Ciphers.

1. **Shift-Cipher**
<br/>
<ul>
<li>A shift cipher is a cipher in which each letter in the message is substituted by a letter a few letters down the alphabet.</li>
<li>The shift k is an integer value in between 0 and 25.</li>
</ul>

2. **Caesar-Cipher**
<br/>
<ul>
<li>A caesar cipher is a cipher in which each letter in the message is substituted by a letter 3 letters down the alphabet. </li>
<li>The shift k is an integer value in between 0 and 25. The Caesar cipher is a specialized case of the Caesar cipher.</li>
<li>In the Caesar cipher, the k value is fixed to 3.</li>
</ul>
